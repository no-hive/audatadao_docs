# Data Flow

Data flow can be seen in live our @app while contributing. All steps are controled by user, by the way. No&#x20;





Our UI will encrypt audio contributions before sending them to Storj – a modern and convenient cloud storage provider specializing in facilitating further data computing.

As you can see, this ensures that audio content remains private, as it is uploaded to the server already encrypted.

Next, we plan to build a UI to give users more control over their uploaded data. For example, users will be able to delete audio files they have previously contributed.

Our final goal is to build a system where data consumers can run queries on users' data without exposing the actual audio content. This data consumer model 'reads' the audio files and provides the computed results to the owner, preventing any direct listening or exposing of private details.&#x20;
