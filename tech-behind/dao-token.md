_$AUDATA_ helps us to maintain all the procesess secure, decentrilized and fair for both parties.

**To understand more clear the token flow see the board below.**

**Data contribution / upload**: _audio ---> storage ---> token ---> user._\
**Data usage for machine learning:** _dev ---> token ---> storage ---> neuronets learn._

**Token&#x20;**_**$AUDATA**_**&#x20;is the key element of data monetization.** \
\
**User receive the token for data upload** and just see it grow as more and more ML specialists are engaged with our tools and our audio dataset. \
\
**Devs (ML specialists) must buy token and burn it to access the storage** with your encrypted audiofiles and let neuronet read it. \
\
**It is the economy to democritize the data safe and secure.** Both users and devs win because there is no third party taking high fees from it.\
\
**You might question, how Audata team get the profit then. if there are no fees, just token flow?**&#x20;

We hold token and earn the same way as users: holding it and keeping the community growing.&#x20;



### **There are two main ways to earn tokens:**

**Method 1** - File Contribution Rewards: Receive tokens for each file you contribute. You can earn up to 1 _$AUDATA_ per file upload.
