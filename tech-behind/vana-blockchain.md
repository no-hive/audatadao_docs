# VANA Blockchain

### We are the part of VANA Blockchain

All data infrastructure utilized by AudataDAO was developed using templates created by VANA to empower small dev teams on their blockchain platform. We are deeply integrated into their ecosystem, working in alignment with their vision for decentralized data ownership.

### So what is VANA?

VANA Blockchain, developed by OpenDataLabs, transforms data into a tradable asset class, enabling users to contribute to AI model training while preserving privacy and earning on-chain rewards.&#x20;

The platform has attracted top-tier investment from firms like Paradigm and a16z, with recent strategic backing and advisory support from CZ (former Binance founder).

### We are proud to be here

For us, VANA is not just another blockchain. It is the community and foundation that supports us.&#x20;

**Moreover, this project is the result of VANA Foundation grant. We could not impelemnt it without their official finicial and technial support.**&#x20;

We are proud to be part of this transformative ecosystem, which we believe will deliver equitable data ownership to millions worldwide.

We believe VANA has a bright future. If you want to become the part of it, here are the links:&#x20;
