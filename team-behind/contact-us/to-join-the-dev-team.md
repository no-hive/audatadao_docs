# to join the dev team

This project is built and supported by [cape4labs.md](../cape4labs.md "mention")team. Feel free to message @no-hive or drop a letter on cape4lans@proton.me to ask if there any positions open in the team. We do not promise to answer you immediately but we always do our best not to ignore anyone's request.

Unfortuntely, the chance we have any roles open is really small, but we would love seeing you contributing to AudataDAO repositories on Github. Find it all here - [codebase.md](../../dao-overview/tech-behind/codebase.md "mention").&#x20;

Lastly, if you ever see a person from our team on any conference, we would love to connect to you so don't mind to reach out.
