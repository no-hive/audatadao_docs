# Cape4labs

Cape4labs is an independent web development studio with a tiny but dedicated team of four. Despite our size, we deliver end-to-end solutions - from UI design to full-stack development and production deployment.

Our primary expertise lies in JavaScript technologies, with a strong specialization in the web3 domain. We’ve built impactful solutions in areas such as blockchain privacy, on-chain data crowdsourcing, and decentralized finance.
