### What is the Vana blockchain?

The Vana network is an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain designed to restore individual control over personal data and enable user-owned AI through private and secure data transactions.

The platform has attracted top-tier investment from Paradigm and a16z, with recent strategic backing and advisory support from Changpeng “CZ” Zhao (former Binance founder).

_$AUDATA_ helps us keep all processes secure, decentralized, and fair for both sides.

**To understand the token flow, see the diagram below.**

**Data contribution / upload**: _audio ---> storage ---> token ---> user._\
**Data usage for machine learning:** _dev ---> token ---> storage ---> model training._

**Token&#x20;**_**$AUDATA**_**&#x20;is the key element of data monetization.**\
\
**Users receive tokens for data uploads** and can see them grow as more ML specialists engage with our tools and audio datasets.\
\
**Devs (ML specialists) must buy tokens and burn them to access storage** with your encrypted audio files and let models learn from them.\
\
**This economy helps democratize data safely and securely.** Users and devs win because there’s no third party taking high fees.\
\
**You might ask how the Audata team makes money if there are no fees and only token flow.**

We hold tokens and earn the same way as users: by holding and growing the community.

### **There are two main ways to earn tokens:**

**Method 1** - File Contribution Rewards: Receive tokens for each file you contribute. You can earn up to 1 _$AUDATA_ per file upload.

**Method 2** - Seasonal Leaderboard **(Major Rewards)**:

1. Complete your account information.
2. Upload files from one wallet.
3. Climb the leaderboard rankings.
4. Receive token drops when the season ends.

This method can yield 100-200x more tokens than the basic contribution rewards.

**Right now Season 0 is live. Visit** [**audata.space**](https://audata.space) **to get started.**
