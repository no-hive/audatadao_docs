# Concept

**AudataDAO provides the AI industry with real, live speech data — securely and ethically.**

Machine learning and AI systems depend on high-quality speech data. Voice assistants, large language models, biometric systems, and academic research all require fresh, diverse, and authentic audio. While many companies attempt to solve this problem, the industry still faces a critical shortage of usable speech data. (More about it here - [utility.md](utility.md "mention")).&#x20;

**So why it is hard to collect the data?**

**The core challenge is trust.** People are unwilling to share private data, and voice messages are among the most sensitive forms of personal information. As a result, most available datasets are outdated, overly curated, emotionally flat, or synthetically generated.

**AudataDAO addresses this challenge at its root.**

We have built a system where users retain full ownership of their audio while enabling AI models to learn from it. All speech data is encrypted on the user’s device and stored securely on AudataDAO servers. Raw audio is never revealed, and no one can listen to it — including AudataDAO itself.

Instead, models interact with the data through secure, privacy-preserving interfaces. This allows engineers to train models without accessing or exposing personal content.

#### How it works, step  by step.&#x20;

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Users send voice messages.**

People contribute natural voice messages from everyday communication.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Audio is encrypted and stored.**

Each recording is encrypted on the user’s device and securely stored. The raw content remains inaccessible to humans.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Contributors become DAO members.**

Everyone who contributes audio automatically becomes a member of AudataDAO and collectively governs the dataset.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Users control the asset.**

The dataset is DAO-owned. Contributors retain control over how their data is used and participate in governance decisions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Datasets are sold to the industry.**

Companies purchase access to structured, privacy-safe datasets for machine learning and research.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Revenue is shared fairly.**

Profits from dataset sales are distributed among DAO members proportionally to their contribution.What the industry gains

{% endstepper %}

#### What the industry gains

* Speech data structured specifically for ML.
* Verified live, non-synthetic audio.
* Diversity of languages, accents, emotions, and spontaneous speech.
* Low costs with no hidden platform fees.

#### What users gain

* Full ownership and governance rights over their data.
* Strong encryption and privacy guarantees.
* A transparent way to monetize voice data.
* Fair profit sharing based on contribution.

**AudataDAO unlocks the world’s most valuable speech data without sacrificing privacy, trust, or ethics. Through encryption, user ownership, and decentralized governance, real-world audio can finally scale for AI in a secure and transparent way.**
