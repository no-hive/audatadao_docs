# Concept

Audata fuels ML and AI with raw speech audio. Others do this too. We do it the secure way.

The industry struggles to get fresh data for models, voice assistants, research, etc. Read [Utility](utility.md) for the industries we focus on. People rarely want to share private data. Voice messages are especially sensitive.

We believe we’ve solved this problem. Now we’re delivering it to the industry.

**So how did we solve it? Why aren’t users afraid to contribute to AudataDAO?**

* **All data is encrypted on the user side and user-owned.**
* **Audio content stays unrevealed, even while it is used.**

No one can listen to the audio. Models can still learn from it through secure interfaces. Engineers still get what they need:

* **Data is structured for ML purposes.**
* **Data is proven to be live and non-generated.**
* **Costs stay low. The AUDATA team adds no extra fees.**
