#### **Why do we collect audio data?**

Raw audio data is essential for many companies, startups, and universities worldwide. It is becoming even more valuable because of the AI revolution—it is the fuel of the post-informational era.

However, data markets are not doing well. Here is [research](https://www.dataprovenance.org/Multimodal_Data_Provenance.pdf) on the current state of the industry.

This research shows a significant lack of data presented in audio format, especially from regions such as Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Moreover, the majority of available audio data comes from audiobooks, TV and radio programs, parliamentary speeches, and podcasts. While this content is live, it is often not very emotional and is rarely spontaneous.

AudataDAO is built to close this gap by providing live speech audio from messengers like Telegram, WhatsApp, and many others. People are used to recording hundreds of voice messages daily. That is the asset we want to help them monetize.

#### **Where can this data be used?**

#### <mark style="color:green;">Speech Recognition</mark>

Developers training systems like Siri and Alexa need different audio samples to improve accuracy with various accents, languages, and background noises.

#### <mark style="color:red;">Healthcare</mark>

Researchers use audio to create tools that can identify diseases like Parkinson's.

#### <mark style="color:purple;">Entertainment</mark>

Game developers, filmmakers, and other content creators use audio to generate realistic voice acting and synthetic voices for characters.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">Security</mark>

Security firms apply voice biometrics for identity authentication.

#### <mark style="color:yellow;">Emotion Detection</mark>

Apps for customer service or mental health use tone and pitch to understand feelings.

#### <mark style="color:blue;">Linguistics</mark>

Universities and research centers use audio to study the diversity of languages and oral speech, exploring its peculiarities based on factors such as age, region, occupation, and education.<br>

**That's why AudataDAO exists. Thousands of companies are looking for data we can provide!**
