# Token Governance (DAO)

Back in [tokenomics.md](tokenomics.md "mention") we told that 32.32 % of tokens will be locked in DAO Treasury.&#x20;

Why so much?

This 32.32 % represents a control package of tokens that will make the AUDATA some аree space to choose its unique way.  It will remain in the treasury, unless several seasons ends. After we drops enough tokens for users, they will have the majority of votes (more than team), and we will start DAO Governace ,achanics.&#x20;

And the key topic to vote for will be Treasuary.

Potential Treasury Usess:

* New season rewards
* Marketing initiatives
* Strategic partnerships
* Token burning programs
* Liquidity provision
* Any other community-approved purposes

Governance & Security:

Unless the community governance structure is fully established and robust, we wsecure the treasury in a multisig Safe wallet to protect against potential security risks.&#x20;

You can check treasury address back here [smart-contracts.md](../tech-behind/smart-contracts.md "mention").
