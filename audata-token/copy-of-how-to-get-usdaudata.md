# Copy of How to get $AUDATA

### **There are two main ways to earn tokens:**

**Method 1** - File Contribution Rewards: Receive tokens for each file you contribute. You can earn up to 1 _$AUDATA_ per file upload.

**Method 2** - Seasonal Leaderboard **(Major Rewards)**:

1. Complete your account information.
2. Upload files from one wallet.
3. Climb the leaderboard rankings.
4. Receive token drops when the season ends.

**This method can yield 100-200x more tokens than the basic contribution rewards.**

**First season starts xx.xx.xxxx and ends xx.xx.xxxxx. Follow us not to miss it.**&#x20;

### Example:

* Upload 100 files = 100 $AUDATA in Method 1 contribution reward.
* Reach #15 on the leaderboard = Legendary NFT from our collection + 5,000 $AUDATA bonus (Method 2 season rewards)\

  **Total potential earnings:** 5,100 $AUDATA + Legendary NFT
