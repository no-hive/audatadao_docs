# AudataDAO Concept

Audata fuels ML & AI industries with raw audio data. We are not the only ones to do it, but we are the only ones to do it in secure and right way. \
\
The industry is struggling to get new data for its models, voice assistants, studies, etc - read[utility-cases.md](utility-cases.md "mention") to find more insutries we are focused on. All is because of people who are rarely ready to give their private data away, especially their voice messages where private topics might be discussed.

&#x20;We believe we have already solved this problem. And now we are delivering it to the indurstry.&#x20;

**So how we've solved it? Why users do not afraid ti contribute to AudataDAO?**&#x20;

**• All data encrypted user-side and user-owned.**\
**• All data content kept unrevealed even while it is used.**

It means anyone never ever will have even a small chance to listen to audios, and neuronets still can learn on it using special interfaces to access it. Morover, it is still demanded by engineers as:&#x20;

* **All data structured properly for ML purposes.**  &#x20;
* **All data proven to be live and non-generated.**&#x20;
* **All data is quite cheap as AUDATA team do not create any extra fees to pay.**&#x20;
