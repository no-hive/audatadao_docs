# Audata Utility

### The industry is not doin' well.

Here you can read [this research](https://www.dataprovenance.org/Multimodal_Data_Provenance.pdf) about the current condition of the industry.&#x20;

You will see that there is a significant lack of data presented in audio format, especially from such areas as Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia.&#x20;

Moreover, the majority of audio data comes from audiobooks, TV and radio programs, parliamentary speeches, and podcasts.&#x20;

While it is live, it is often not very emotional and rarely spontaneous. This presents another challenge that we are eager to overcome.
