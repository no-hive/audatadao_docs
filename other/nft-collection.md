# NFT Collection

We want to lauch NFT collection to make a first step to build the ecisystem, not just one app.&#x20;

Check it in [roadmap.md](../welcome/roadmap.md "mention")to get insights whether there is a mint date there.&#x20;

Soon we want to launch to our own collection (will be on Base) so we can reward our user with not just tokens but pieces of our $AUDATA galaxy. \
\
Right now our artists are working on to get combine sound, pixel autentics and BMO-from-Adventure-times aethetics.&#x20;
