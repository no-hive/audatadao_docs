# DApp Contribution Guide

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### **Register**

Visit our DApp website. Connect your EVM wallet (MetaMask recommended).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Provide your metadata.

To make your contribution more valuable, you’ll be asked for your year of birth, country of origin, and 1–2 questions about your occupation/education.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Download a few Telegram audios.

Download audio from Telegram (.ogg format). Make sure the files contain **your** voice. Do not upload other people’s voices.

_Don’t know how to download audio from Telegram? Check the second guide:_ [Audio Download Guide](audio-download-guide.md#how-to-download-an-audio-recording-from-telegram)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Upload your audio data.

Choose the language of the audio you’re contributing. Drop files into the upload box. You can upload several files at once.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Sign all the transactions.

You’ll need to sign several transactions. One of them encrypts your audio, making the upload process private.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Receive tokens!

This is the best part: you get paid for contributing audio to the DAO dataset. Check your wallet in a few minutes. If everything was done right, tokens will be there.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Still have issues?

If the flow is still unclear, check [this video](https://youtu.be/z5G4HkJ90fQ) or ask questions on our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1153824909806551152/1402731741072068752).
